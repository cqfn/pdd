  As a source code writer I want to be able to
  call PDD as a command line tool

  Scenario: Help can be printed
    When I run bin/pdd with "-h"
    Then Exit code is zero
    And Stdout contains "-v, --verbose"

  Scenario: Version can be printed
    When I run bin/pdd with "--version"
    Then Exit code is zero

  Scenario: Simple puzzles collecting
    Given I have a "Sample.java" file with content:

       * @todo #13 Привет, Let's do it later, dude
       *  or maybe even never :)

      public void main(String[] args) {
        // later
      }
    }
    """
